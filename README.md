# **üè• Interactive Healthcare Data Analtyics Project with Dashboard** #

## **Overview** ##

This project is a comprehensive data analytics solution designed to explore, analyze, and visualize healthcare data. Using the **Healthcare Stroke Dataset** from Kaggle, I developed a professional-grade **interactive dashboard** that highlights key insights into stroke occurrences based on patient demographics and lifestyle factors. This project not only showcases my technical expertise but also my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights through compelling storytelling and visualization.

# **Project Features** #

* **Data Exploration & Analysis:**
    * Used **SQL (SQLite)** to efficiently query and explore key metrics, such as the correlation between smoking status, age, and stroke occurrences.
    * Created calculated columns like age groups to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset.
* **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**
    * Cleaned and processed the dataset using **Python (Pandas)** to ensure the accuracy and reliability of insights.
    * Engineered new features (e.g., age groups) to enable detailed subgroup analysis.
* **Data Visualizations:**
    * Developed visually engaging and insightful charts using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Dash**, including:
    * **Pie Chart:** Stroke distribution across age groups.
    * **Line Graph:** Trends in glucose levels by age.
    * **Enhanced Pivot Table:** Stroke risk by age group and smoking status, including calculated stroke percentages.
* **Interactive Dashboard:**
    * Designed a professional **dashboard with Dash** to present insights in an accessible and user-friendly way.
    * Incorporated interactive visuals and organized sections, allowing non-technical users to easily understand the results.

## **Skills Demonstrated** ##

This project highlights my proficiency in:

* **Data Analytics:**
    * Advanced querying with **SQL** to extract key insights.
    * Detailed analysis and feature engineering using **Python (Pandas)**.
* **Data Visualization:**
    * Creating interactive and static visuals with tools like **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Dash**.
    * Designing dashboards that translate complex data into actionable narratives.
* **Critical Thinking & Communication:**
    * Translating raw data into clear, meaningful insights for stakeholders.
    * Creating a data-driven foundation for decision-making in healthcare and beyond.
 
## **Why This Project Matters** ## 

In industries like **healthcare** and **finance**, the ability to make data-driven decisions is critical. This project demonstrates how I can:
